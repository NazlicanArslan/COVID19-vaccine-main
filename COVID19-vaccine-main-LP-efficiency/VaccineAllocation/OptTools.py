# OptTools.py
# This module contains Opt(imization) Tools, and includes functions
#   for generating realistic sample paths, enumerating candidate policies,
#   and optimization.
# This module is not used to run the SEIR model. This module contains
#   functions "on top" of the SEIR model.

# Each function in this module can run on a single processor,
#   and can be parallelized by passing a unique processor_rank to
#   each function call.

# In this code, "threshold" refers to a 5-tuple of the thresholds for a policy
#   and "policy" is an instance of MultiTierPolicy -- there's a distinction
#   between the identifier for an object versus the actual object.

    This function uses an accept-reject procedure to
        "realistic" sample paths , using a "time blocks"
        heuristic (see Algorithm 1 in Yang et al. 2021) and using
        an R-squared type statistic based on historical hospital
        data (see pg. 10 in Yang et al. 2021).
    Realistic sample paths are exported as .json files so that
        they can be loaded in another session.
    One primary use of exporting realistic sample paths is that
        testing a policy (for example for optimization)
        only requires simulating the policy from the end
        of the historical time period. We can simulate any
        number of policies starting from the last timepoint of a
        pre-generated sample path, rather than starting from
        scratch at a timepoint t=0.
    Note that in the current version of the code, t=783
        is the end of the historical time period (and policies
        go in effect after this point).

    This function can be parallelized by passing a unique
        processor_rank to each function call.

    We use "sample path" and "replication" interchangeably here
        (Sample paths refer to instances of SimReplication).
